# Project challenge [DIO](https://www.dio.me/): Podcast Manager

Challenge from the Node.js course by [Felipe Aguiar](https://github.com/felipeAguiarCode)

In this project, I developed an application that centralizes different podcast episodes organized by category. The goal of this project is to make it easier to access and organize video-format podcast episodes, providing users with an intuitive and enjoyable browsing experience.

## Running the project

- `npm i` to install the dependencies
- `npm run start:dev` to run the project

## Endpoints

- "/api/list" 
- "/api/podcasts?p=podcast-name-to-filter"
